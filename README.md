# Java-Beginner

• 1991	- James	Gosling,	Sun	Microsystems,	Inc.<br/>	
• Originally	a	platform	independent	language	for	
programming	home	appliances	and	was	called	“Oak”	
later	renamed	“Java”	in	1995.	<br/>	
• Later	(1994)	used	for	World	Wide	Web	applications	(since	byte	code	can	be	
downloaded	and	run	without	compiling	it)	<br/>	
• Eventually	used	as	a	general-purpose	programming	language	(for	the	same	
reason	as	above	plus	it	is	object-oriented)	<br/>	
• Why	the	name	“Java”?	Java	was	then	named	“Java”,	paying	homage	to	the	
large	amounts	of	coffee	consumed	by	the	team.<br/>		
• Now	owns	by	Oracle <br/><br/>
